master.sh changes:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ZRANGE gets changed from 50 to 25 in order to take out the unphysical peaks

p0 is declared in rg file, set to 0
p1 is declared in rg file, set to 0

line 352: max and min are defined again as $ZRANGE and -$ZRANGE respectively

If[$SYMMETRIZE] control sequence is removed

line 374: t1-t5 are declared with added control sequence, to implement geometric disorder

line 406: t1-t5 are declared with added control sequence, to implement geometric disorder





CHANGED I AM MAKING NOW: GUTTING THE SON MATRIX PART, TO FOCUS ON BASE FUNCTIONALITY AND REMOVE VARIABLES
REVERTING TO ORIGINAL CONTROL SEQUENCE NEAR LINE 352

MY TEST IS IN THE FOLDER 0-RG-100000000-5

RG Files are producing the following error:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current Iteration: 2
Current Process: 4
Test2
Generating data from previous distribution

Syntax::com: Warning: comma encountered with no adjacent expression. The expression will be treated as Null. .

---Generated distribution to perform RG step upon
---RG step 0% done
---RG step 50% done

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

but still are producing distributions




pushmaster.sh changes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ZRANGE gets changed from 50 to 25 in order to take out the unphysical peaks
rgfile import control sequence is heavily shortened

p0 is declared in rg file, it was set to 0.05???
p1 is declared in rg file, it was set to 0.05???

line350: t1-t5 are declared with added control sequence, to implement geometric disorder

end of file: last line on symmetrising the file is deleted


CHANGED I AM MAKING NOW: IMMEDIATELY CHANGING P0 AND P1 TO 0, reverting to original import control sequence




SUCCESS!!!!
